# afterwind

A utility library for writing composable Tailwind CSS. It elevates Tailwind usage from working primitive strings to something you can compose, override, extract, nest, conditionally apply, etc, without needing to resort to messy and unpleasant string manipulation.

## Installation

Install with npm

```bash
  npm i afterwind # or yarn add afterwind or pnpm pnpm add afterwind
```
